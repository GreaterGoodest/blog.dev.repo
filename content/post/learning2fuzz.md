## Introduction

I've been doing software development and cyber security related work for a decent time now, and figured it was finally time to find some real vulnerabilities in well known native applications. Of course, I'm far too lazy to manually reverse engineer things myself, so I decided to learn how to fuzz. As an added bonus, you get to put cool stuff on your terminal that makes it look like you know what you're doing!

I was able to pick up the basics pretty quickly, and even found 3 CVEs in the process. Now it's time to document my processes (hopefully I haven't already forgotten) so that I remember how to do this in future. Maybe someone else will benefit from this too!
